# Pathogen Incidence Modelling - Case Study 1

## Instructions for Use

This repository contains three scripts used to **recreate the analysis** in **Case Study 1**. These scripts are detailed in the table below.

## Installation

Before running any of the scripts, install or load the required packages using the following command in R:

``` r
source("R/packages/install_packages.R")
```

## Usage

Run the scripts in the following order:

1.  **`1_visualise_data.R`** â†’ Maps pathogen incidence locations, incidence rates, and temperature data.\
2.  **`2_fit_gams.R`** â†’ Fits **Generalized Additive Models** (GAMs) to analyse the relationship between temperature and pathogen incidence. Compares model performance.\
3.  **`3_fit_gmrf.R`** â†’ Fits a **Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF)** using **INLA** to model pathogen incidence.
